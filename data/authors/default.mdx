Hi, my name is Flinn, I'm a full-stack web developer working primarily with TypeScript. I've been a professional developer since graduating the University of York in 2018.

This website is part of a plan to learn in public, where I can write longer-form content exploring ideas that take my interest. For less structured content, check out the link to my digital garden above.

In my free time I like reading, playing video games and working on my house, among other things.

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn. You can find a link to my account at the bottom of this page.
